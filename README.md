RASIX FÃ–RINI
(everything starts with a letter)

- no disturbing letters (H, CH, SH, SCH)
- no derivative letters (W, Q, G, J)
- words should sound well for listener

- every letter in a word should explain the meaning, to best extent
- no manipulative words, such as [order, request... etc]


- no word for "good/bad". Quality-wise case quality may be used.
- no word in place of "for, because"
- no word in place of "do, make, render", has no meaning in 


- plurals using relationships, alternatively by adding suffix "O"
